# Scodoc
Scodoc is a web-based platform developed for teachers to efficiently manage student records and school administration tasks. As part of a collaborative project, our team drafted a comprehensive requirements document to ensure alignment with specific functionality and usability goals. We designed both a Conceptual Data Model (CDM) and a Logical Data Model (LDM) in UML, implemented a PostgreSQL database with a structured SQL script, and developed custom queries for streamlined data management.

To enhance data accessibility, we imported a database view into Excel, enabling calculations and graphical analysis, and created two Power BI dashboards that visually represent key information from the same data view. This end-to-end project demonstrates robust data visualization to simplify administrative workflows in educational settings.
